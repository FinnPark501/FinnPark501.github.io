OTA Project 1 - the Beginning
===
Nearly four years have passed since I closed my first Git page blog. For some reason, I felt a strong urge to advance my career. That's why I'm posting this.

I'm basically an embedded C SW Developer. Therefore, instead of focusing on glamorous areas like web and app development, it's more sensible to concentrate on a domain closer to embedded software.

Every time I searched the internet, I felt that the demand for embedded software systems in vehicles, such as automobiles and construction equipment I've worked on, is waning. On the contrary, C++/Python-based Linux systems are growing.

Perhaps, I could get a chance in my current job due to the poor development environment. The functions of vehicles are becoming more and more complicated, so that embedded systems are not fit for those requirements.

Anyway, today I came up with a cool project idea: OTA.

I plan to build an OTA system on Linux and study OTA development. This will be a good chance to learn about C++/Python/Linux/OS/Architecture/...

After consulting with ChatGPT-4, I found a suitable Linux version, AGL.

AGL is

I was able to find supported hardware. I chose a suitable Raspberry Pi and purchased it.

I checked to see if the latest Raspberry Pi I had purchased a long time ago was usable, but it had already been over 7 years since I purchased it and I couldn't use it... Time...

While waiting for delivery, I will read documents and draw the architecture of the project.
